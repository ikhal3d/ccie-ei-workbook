# 🛠️ CCIE Enterprise Infrastructure Workbook

## 👋 Welcome!

G’day! I’m Khaled, a Network Engineer on the journey to conquer the **CCIE Enterprise Infrastructure** certification.

This repository is my personal collection of notes, labs, diagrams, and resources that I’m building and refining as I go.

My goal is to keep everything current, accurate, and useful not just for myself, but for anyone else chasing the same beast. Let’s make studying a bit more fun, eh? 🎯

## ❓ What’s This About?

The CCIE EI exam blueprint changes as tech evolves. I’m maintaining this repo to:

- 🗃️ Keep my study materials organised.
- 🚀 Share updates when Cisco changes the blueprint.
- 🖥️ Create labs and diagrams that reflect real-world scenarios.
- 🤝 Encourage collaboration so others can pitch in with improvements.

## 🛠️ How Should You Use These Files?

Everything here is meant to **complement your official Cisco study materials**. Use this repo:

- 🔎 As a quick reference for config snippets.
- 🖼️ To visualise concepts through diagrams.
- 🧪 To find lab ideas for practice.
- 📚 To read concise notes on specific topics.

⚠️ This is **not** a replacement for official Cisco documentation or training — but it’s a bloody good companion for the journey.

## 🤝 How to Contribute

I’d love to make this a collaborative project. If you’re studying for CCIE EI (or already hold it), feel free to:

- 💡 Submit pull requests for updates, corrections, or new lab ideas.
- 🎨 Share diagrams, configs, or clarifications on tricky topics.
- 🐞 Report bugs or typos in the notes or labs.

Let’s help each other smash this exam!

## 🗒️ Notes About Lab Materials

I recommend downloading the lab exercises from this repo and running them in your preferred lab environment (EVE-NG, GNS3, CML, PNETLab, etc.).

While you’re welcome to browse directly on GitHub, it’s usually easier to **clone locally** or download files so you can open diagrams and edit configs easily.

## 🙏 Acknowledgements

Massive thanks to everyone in the networking community sharing knowledge, tips, and encouragement.

Special shoutout to the legends who keep pushing boundaries and helping make complex topics more accessible.

Cheers,
Khaled
