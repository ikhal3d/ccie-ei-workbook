# CCIE Enterprise Infrastructure Workbook

## Welcome!

G’day! I’m Khaled, a Network Engineer on the journey to conquer the CCIE Enterprise Infrastructure certification. This repository is my personal collection of notes, labs, diagrams, and study resources that I’m building and refining as I go.

My goal is to keep everything current, accurate, and useful not just for myself, but for anyone else aiming for the same goal. I’m passionate about sharing knowledge and learning from others in the networking community.

## What’s This About?

The CCIE EI exam blueprint evolves as technologies change. I’m maintaining this repo to:

- Keep my study materials organised.
- Share updates when Cisco releases new topics or changes exam focus.
- Create labs and diagrams that reflect real-world scenarios.
- Encourage collaboration so others can contribute improvements, corrections, or additional insights.

## How Should You Use These Files?

Everything here is meant to complement your official Cisco study materials and whatever third-party resources you’re using. Use this repo:

- As a quick reference for config snippets.
- To visualise concepts through diagrams.
- To find lab ideas to practise.
- To read concise study notes on specific topics.

This is **not** a replacement for official Cisco documentation or training — but it’s a good companion for the journey.

## How to Contribute

I’d love to make this a collaborative project. If you’re studying for CCIE EI (or already hold the cert), feel free to:

- Submit a pull request for updates, corrections, or new lab ideas.
- Share diagrams, configs, or clarifications on tricky topics.
- Report bugs or typos in the notes or labs.

Let’s help each other ace this beast of an exam!

## Notes About Lab Materials

I recommend downloading the lab exercises from this repo and running them in your preferred lab environment (EVE-NG, GNS3, CML, PNETLab, etc.).

While you’re welcome to explore the repo directly on GitHub, it’s usually easier to clone it locally or download the files so you can open diagrams and edit configs easily.
